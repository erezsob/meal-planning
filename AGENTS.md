## System primitives

Compose documented primitives before inventing local equivalents. See [docs/PRIMITIVES.md](docs/PRIMITIVES.md) for the composition contract (UI, data/API, platform workflows, trust boundaries). The machine-readable map is [docs/contributing/architecture/primitives.yaml](docs/contributing/architecture/primitives.yaml) — use it for path-to-primitive mapping and PR visual-recap classification; keep it in sync with `PRIMITIVES.md` when adding or reshaping primitives.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

GitHub Issues via `gh`; external PRs are not a triage surface. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default vocabulary: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: root `GLOSSARY.md` + `docs/adr/`. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

# Using Vite+, the Unified Toolchain for the Web

This project is using Vite+, a unified toolchain built on top of Vite, Rolldown, Vitest, tsdown, Oxlint, Oxfmt, and Vite Task. Vite+ wraps runtime management, package management, and frontend tooling in a single global CLI called `vp`. Vite+ is distinct from Vite, and it invokes Vite through `vp dev` and `vp build`. Run `vp help` to print a list of commands and `vp <command> --help` for information about a specific command.

Docs are local at `node_modules/vite-plus/docs` or online at https://viteplus.dev/guide/.

## Built-in Commands vs Scripts

`vp <name>` runs a built-in command. `vp run <name>` runs a `package.json` script or a `vite.config.ts` task. Scripts cannot overwrite built-ins, so `vp dev` and `vp run dev` may do different things. Check `package.json` and `vite.config.ts` first, and run `vp run <name>` when the project defines a script or task with that name.

## Running Scripts

Run TypeScript and JavaScript files with `vpx <file>`, for example `vpx ./scripts/seed.ts --dry-run`. It handles enums, decorators, JSX, and tsconfig `paths`, so do not add `tsx` or `ts-node` to run scripts. `vpx --watch <file>` reruns the file when a file it uses changes, in place of `tsx watch`. `vp node <file>` runs plain Node.js.

## Tool Versions

Run `vp toolchain` to show versions and relationships in the active Vite+
release. Add a tool name to select part of the graph. For example, run
`vp toolchain vite`. Use `--global` to ignore the local `vite-plus` package. Use
`vp why <package>` to show the package-manager dependency graph.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Run `vp install` after pulling remote changes and before getting started.
- [ ] Run `vp check` and `vp test` to format, lint, type check and test changes.
- [ ] Check if there are `vite.config.ts` tasks or `package.json` scripts necessary for validation, run via `vp run <script>`.
- [ ] If setup, runtime, or package-manager behavior looks wrong, run `vp env doctor` and include its output when asking for help.

**UI verification:** after route, component, or style changes, follow `.cursor/rules/ui-verification.mdc`. Run `pnpm test:e2e` (Playwright smoke against the dev server). For layout or motion, also use the Chrome DevTools tools. Do not use the Cursor built-in browser. Do not commit `test-results/` or `.cursor/verification/` screenshots.

## Product docs

Implementation references live in `.docs/`. `docs/` is agent workflow and domain decisions.
